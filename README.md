# Data-Projects
This is repository of recent and older projects (Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Kaggle Competitions)
These are random projects that I have done over the years and I wanted to put them up on GitHub.
These notebooks are in python and in R and are just for me to go back a look on them to see the growth that I am making.
I would like to thank Fastai and Jeremy Howard personally for creating the community of passionate individuals. 
I have learned just as much from the community he has created as I have from his course. 
I love the world of Data Science and I love learning about new approaches and techniques. 
There is never a week that goes by that I don't learn something new or need to research something.
Therefore, this field is so perfect for me because it keeps me on my toes. 

Note the R code is from my earlier work and python is what I am using the most these days. 
These notebooks are anywhere from a week old to a year and half old currently. My advice is to keep learning and don't give up it's worth it. One thing about this field is that you will look back at what you have done and be very impressed with our ability. 
Remember we have a ethical duty to keep data integrity and make sure our machine learning projects aren't leading to biased outcomes. 
If you come across this folder I hope that the work is helpful or at least a jumping point. :)
