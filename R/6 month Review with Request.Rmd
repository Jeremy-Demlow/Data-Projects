## Requests

**Report 1:**
All job seekers without matches. Really need their registration source included in the report so that I can check the DXC separately.

**Status:** *Complete* (Found in LJCUserNoMatches.csv)
      
**Report 2:**
I need the zip code location of all job seekers registered between 3/3-3/9 and perhaps a heat map or location-identified map along with it.

**Status:** *Complete* (Found in Request2.csv)

**WARNING** Postal Code, Zip Code and City/State isn't being collected properly and this bug is being worked on.

Below is a chart of the path on, which there are no matches followed by number of resumes completed in this group and then it is showing the count per page per resume completed or not with a percentage.

    - How the resume was added (if added â€“ upload or manual) (Pending)

## **Who Is Completing Their Resumes**

- A Breakdown of degree type and Resume Completion.

- If I am correct, it looks as though "Jobseeker-Events", "DXC Technology Nola" and "Globalstar"", which I believe are events. Even if the last two aren't there is still much higher rate of resumes not being completed with jobseeker events. I know we have pushed a more mobile friendly version so this will be interesting to see if these changes change the resume completition. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
#colnames(Last6.added)
Last6.added$access.Date <- as.POSIXct(Last6.added$access.Date)
Last6.added$Resume.Date <- as.POSIXct(Last6.added$Resume.Date)
Last6.added$resumecompletefl= as.factor(Last6.added$resumecompletefl)
Last6.added$degree = as.character(Last6.added$degree)
Last6.added$degree[Last6.added$degree==" "]<-"Missing"
Last6.added$degree = as.factor(Last6.added$degree)

## **LJC Activity, Time it Takes For Resumes to be Completed & Time Since Last Visit**

-	Of the 5,018 added members of the LJC website 42% of the new members have completed their resumes.

    - From my understanding if there isn't a completed resume then each they can recieve is zero meaning that more than 50% of the recuirtment of employees is lost because resumes aren't being fully completed. 

-	Of that 42% (2152 members) 86% percent of them are posting and completing their resumes right away.  You can see from the chart below by registration source, which groups are taking longer as whole to post. 

    - Of the 2152 LJC members that have completed their resumes 1857 of them completed them on the day of sign up. 293 of them came back and finished them. 
    
    - The 293 members here are the quantiles of when they come back to finish their resumes. The largest amount of time fo an individual to come back and finish their resume was 122.  In the sub-group the mean time to complete thier resume was 13.59 days. With their being a couple outliers a more reliable metric is 3.20 is a better metric as you have a couple large outliers pulling the mean.

## **Looking At The Number of Applications**

A surprising stat came about from this exploration and that is there are more applications being sent out by individuals that havenâ€™t come back to the LJC site than ones that have come back. The proportion of applicants to number of apps is higher for those that come back, but that should be expected as they are active users. Being active suggests that you are actively looking for a job or are in the market to change careers.

-	Of the 2152 new LJC members with resumes 469 of them have come back to the site since registration and have applied to 165 jobs. The other 1683 members had applied to 366 jobs the day of registration but havenâ€™t made it back to the site.

## The End 

I just wanted to see if this kind of report gets you thinking of anything else that you would like me to look into more carefully. 

I hope you enjoyed,
